In this project, we will model and study the behavior of N birds sitting on a line on a telephone wire. In the model, each bird will try to adjust to find a comfortable standing position. The inspiration came from watching the Pixar short movie [For the Birds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6X80IWdS6s).


This project was done by Luca Barriviera and Wenbin Yan as part of the Master's course *Markov Processes and Applications* by Professors Vincent Bansaye and Cl√©ment Rey.
